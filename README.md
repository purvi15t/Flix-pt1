### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* Dealing with multiple labels and formating it accordingly. 
* Downloading Cocoa Pods and ensuring that it is downloaded into the directory and dealing with URL labels in swift code to be able to show poster. 
* Switching between the two swift files can be confusing.
